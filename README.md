# HTML CSS Git: Code Refractor

## Description 

Web accessibility is an important consideration for businesses. It ensures people with disabilities can access a website using technologies such as video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards, and much more. This project is an example of a scenario in which a marketing agency has hired the user to refactor an existing site to make it more acessible. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
